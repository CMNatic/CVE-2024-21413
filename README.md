# CVE-2024-21413
This Python script is used to abuse the [CVE-2024-21413](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2024-21413) coined "MonikerLink"

## Assumptions
This PoC has been created for a lab environment which means the server needs to be configured in a specific setting (i.e. TLS authentication is not supported for convenience). The actual vulnerability is very real, however, this is provided as a training ground.

## Victim
The victim runs a hMailserver with the following inboxes:
- attacker@monikerlink.thm
- victim@monikerlink.thm

The password for the mailboxes are the same as the username i.e. `attacker:attacker`.

## Attacker
1. You will need to edit your hosts file to have the machine in your hosts file
	- `IPADDRESS monikerlink.thm`

2. You need to setup a responder on the interface
	- `responder -I eth0`

Alternatively, you can start an impacket server:
- `impacket-smbserver -smb2support -ip 0.0.0.0 test /tmp`


## Lab
I have uploaded the machine that runs the mailsever and outlook client as an OVA. I will not guarantee it's availability as I soon expect to have a room on TryHackMe for this. You can download it [here](http://cmnatic.helios.feralhosting.com/ovas/)
